= Search Wrapper
<b>Version 0.0.1 (Nov 25, 2007)</b>

Author::	Rick Bradley (mailto:rick@ogconsultin.gs)

The Search Wrapper provides a wrapper around the Ultrasphinx Rails search
plugin.  Search Wrapper provides a Model.search() class method for any
ActiveRecord::Base models in the application.  The Model.search method will
simply call the generic Ultrasphinx::Search method, setting the model class to
be searched to Model, and passing along any provided options to
Ultrasphinx::Search.

== Installation

Unpack the search_wrapper directory into vendor/rails/ in your rails project.

== Testing

Install the rspec and mocha gems, then cd into the search_wrapper directory.
Type 'spec spec/' and you should see all specs run successfully. If you have
autotest from the ZenTest gem installed you can run autotest in that directory.

== Using  Search Wrapper

  Drug.search(:query => 'tylenol').size  =>  20

  ActiveRecord::Base.search(:query => 'dude', :class_names => [ 'Entry', 'AccountProvider']) => [ ... ]
